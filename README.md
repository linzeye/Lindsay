## What do you want us to know about your communication style?
- I like facts! I  best understand precise, straightforward instructions rather than subtle explanations.
- I'm fairly direct and to the point, but I like to consider what I say first to make sure it comes across in the best way.


## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
- I love to help. I like to pitch in and make suggestions. 
- I might not be right always, and I'm happy to hear when I'm not.

## How can you best work with me?

## What are your pet peeves?

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
