## What do you want us to know about your communication style?
- I like facts! I best understand precise, straightforward instructions rather than subtle explanations.
- I'm fairly direct and to the point, but I like to consider what I say first to make sure it comes across in the best way.
- I appreciate an environment where everyone wins together.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
- I love to help. I like to pitch in and make suggestions.
- I enjoy low-key discussions, where everyone's contribution can be heard.
- I need independence and autonomy.
- I am idealistic and trusting.

## How can you best work with me?
- I'm super organised. So I like events and tasks that I can put in my calendar.
- For that reason I like to have time for tasks so I can plan them into my schedule.
- I love to have honest and frank discussions where possible.

## What are your pet peeves?
- Inconsideration for others. 
- Aggresive people/reactions. Anger is a valid emotion, but there are appropriate times to show it.
- Neglect for effort/detail.


## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- I'm too self-critical.
- Worrying about something that might not happen.
- I will sometimes avoid conflict. Please call me out on this, I'm trying to do better here.
- I am sometimes unconsciously oppositional - again call me out on that, let's talk about something, I can be persuaded with good facts.
