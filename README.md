# About Lindsay, the human!

## Communication style
- I like facts! I best understand precise, straightforward instructions rather than subtle explanations.
- I'm fairly direct and to the point, but I like to consider what I say first to make sure it comes across in the best way.
- I appreciate an environment where everyone wins together.

## Work Style
- I love to help. I like to pitch in and make suggestions.
- I enjoy low-key discussions, where everyone's contribution can be heard.
- I need independence and autonomy.
- I am idealistic and trusting.

## How to best work with me
- I'm super organised. So I like events and tasks that I can put in my calendar.
- For that reason I like to have time for tasks so I can plan them into my schedule.
- I love to have honest and frank discussions where possible.

## My pet peeves
- Inconsideration for others. 
- Aggressive people/reactions. Anger is a valid emotion, but there are appropriate times to show it.
- Neglect for effort/detail.


## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- I'm too self-critical.
- Worrying about something that might not happen.
- I will sometimes avoid conflict. Please call me out on this, I'm trying to do better here.
- I am sometimes unconsciously oppositional - again call me out on that, let's talk about something, I can be persuaded with good facts.
- I'm occasionally overly interested/enthusiastic which might come across as micro-management. Again please call me out on this and I can step back!

# What my role looks like

**I’m a support team manager**, heading up the High Value team. It’s my job to strategize the vision for the high value team through planning, procurement and execution. Whilst the team is still very new and small I like to remain very hands-on getting involved in all areas at a high level. See more about the team, our vision, tasks, projects and goals here: https://zapier.quip.com/folder/high-value


**I’m a people manager** - It’s my job to effectively develop and support my team to enable them to perform highly and get the most out of their Zapier career. This can encompass a number of tasks from 1:1s, reviews, coaching, training, support and advice. 

I’m also in the Support **Defenders team** which contains leadership members: Pam, Kris, Micah, Thomas, Bill and Richard. I bring Zapier expertise and contribute to leadership decisions to help set the direction of the support org. 

## recurring meetings
These meetings need prep and attending each week.

- Defenders meeting with support leadership
  - This is a high level discussion with other support leaders around decisions we are making and ensuring we all stay aligned. Action Items from these can now be found in the Support Newsletter.
- 1:1s with all of my directs and my manager
  - Each week I will investigate performance for the team and individuals via a spreadsheet. Right now I am staying very close to team data to see and jump on when changes might need to happen and make informed decisions while we grow. After this data has been logged, I will begin prepping 1:1s. Each 1:1 will have a weekly team progress update, individual performance update and topics of conversation. These get added too dynamically if anything comes up in the week.

These meetings are not weekly, but recurring:
- Premier Support Team meeting
We share responsibility for running this, but I’ll still make sure all updates the whole team need to know are included, 
- OKR monthly check-in
- 6 monthly OKR discussion meetings to set the direction of the team.
- Pair buddies
- Manager Roundtable
- Support Team Meeting
I need to prep an update for Premier Support here.
- All hands meeting
