# About Lindsay, the human!

## Communication style
- I like facts! I best understand precise, straightforward instructions rather than subtle explanations.
- I'm fairly direct and to the point, but I like to consider what I say first to make sure it comes across in the best way.
- I appreciate an environment where everyone wins together.

## Work Style
- I love to help. I like to pitch in and make suggestions.
- I enjoy low-key discussions, where everyone's contribution can be heard.
- I need independence and autonomy.
- I am idealistic and trusting.

## How to best work with me
- I'm very organized.  I like meetings, projects and tasks that I can put in my calendar.
- 	For that reason, I like to have ample notice for tasks so that I can plan them into my schedule.
- I love to have honest and frank discussions where possible.

## My pet peeves
- Inconsideration for others. 
- Neglect for effort/detail.
- Excuses. If you are going to miss a deadline that's okay, but I want to know about it beforehand so we work on a solution.


## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- I am sometimes unconsciously oppositional -  call me out on that, let's talk about it, I can be persuaded with good facts.
- I'm occasionally overly interested/enthusiastic which might come across as micro-management. Again, please call me out on this and I can step back!

# What my role looks like

**I’m a senior manager**, heading up the Customer Success team. It’s my job to strategize the vision for the Customer Success team through planning, procurement, and execution. Whilst the team is still very new and small I like to remain very hands-on getting involved in all areas at a high level.

**I’m a people manager** - It’s my job to effectively develop and support my team to enable them to perform highly and get the most out of their Zapier career. This can encompass several tasks from 1:1s, reviews, coaching, training, support, and advice. 

I’m in the Support **Defenders team** which contains leadership members: Pam, Kris, Micah, Lauren, and Richard. I bring Zapier expertise and contribute to leadership decisions to help set the direction of the support org. 

**I'm a key stakeholder for the Jupiter Initiative**
